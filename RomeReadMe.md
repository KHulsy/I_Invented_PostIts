Abstract: It's my understanding that the focal point of this project is to be able to connect front end development with back end development. In my journey of drowning and flailing through dolphin noises,
I downloaded both Storybook and React. For whatever reason, I thought that JS was going to be a conduit to getting this done. I've had Postman downloaded for approximately 72 hours, the same amount of time with the dolphin program.
I don't know what I'm doing, and I am confident that I will learn it in the next 4-9 days. I don't know how to do Backend development yet. I did put about fifteen hours into Project Gwenom this weekend in the interest of having it closer to finished. I am now a few active links and a start screen away from that reality.
I'm probably about eight hours from being presentation ready. Also, I learned Nano, and I've been practicing requestListener/setHeader function calls for the last three hours, and have downloaded Nano. 
Next up is serving CSV. I'm going to read those. For now, I am not a backend developer today. I have no doubt that I will resemble a backend developer within the next month. Thank you for your time, and please enjoy your evening.
Best,
Kait.
